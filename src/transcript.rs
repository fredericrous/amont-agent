//! Reading Claude Code's session transcripts.
//!
//! Claude Code appends one JSON object per line to
//! `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-path>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`. Every tool
//! call it ever made is in there, which is what makes a rule's fire rate a
//! measurable quantity instead of an opinion.
//!
//! Four decisions in here exist because getting them wrong produces numbers
//! that look right:
//!
//! 1. **Bucket on the entry's own `timestamp`, never the file's mtime.** A
//!    session open for six hours has one mtime and hundreds of entries spread
//!    across it; a resumed session has an mtime weeks after its contents. Using
//!    mtime collapses a whole session into whatever day it was last touched,
//!    and the resulting weekly table is confidently wrong. Measured both ways
//!    while planning this: they disagree materially.
//!
//! 2. **Filter on the entry's own `cwd`, never the directory name.** The
//!    project directory is a lossy encoding of a path —
//!    `-Users-me-Developer-my-project` cannot be decoded, because a literal
//!    dash and a path separator both became `-`.
//!
//! 3. **Deduplicate on `tool_use.id`.** Resuming or forking a session copies
//!    earlier entries into the new transcript. Those are the same tool call
//!    observed twice, and counting them twice inflates exactly the busy
//!    sessions that dominate a bucket.
//!
//! 4. **A truncated final line is normal, not corruption.** A session being
//!    written right now ends mid-object. Skip it, count it, keep the file.
//!
//! ## What is not here
//!
//! Sessions run on the web are not on this machine, so no scan can see them.
//! Every report says so rather than quietly under-reporting.
