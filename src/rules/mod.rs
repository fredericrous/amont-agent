//! The rules, and the contract every rule obeys.
//!
//! A rule is one module plus one line in [`RULES`] — the same shape
//! amont's `registry::CHECKS` uses, and for the same reason: a rule's
//! name, its default stance and its function are declared together, so adding
//! one cannot half-happen.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT registered in `registry::CHECKS`. That table is the set of
//! things that gate a commit, `crates/amont/tests/docs_counts.rs` asserts on
//! its length against counts spelled out in three prose files, and these rules
//! gate nothing in git.
//!
//! ## Two devices carry the precision
//!
//! **[`Rule::examine`] is pure.** No processes, no filesystem, no network. It
//! runs on every Bash call the model makes, so anything it touches is paid for
//! thousands of times a week. Purity is also what makes the backtester honest:
//! a rule that consulted the world during `examine` could not be replayed
//! against a transcript, because the world has moved.
//!
//! **[`Rule::confirm`] runs only after `examine` has already fired.** It is the
//! one place a rule may look at the world, and it exists to turn a heuristic
//! into a fact — "is this repository actually shared across worktrees?", "does
//! this glob actually match nothing?". Fires are rare, so the cost is rare.

// A `fish-glob` rule was written and removed before the first commit. It caught
// an unquoted glob inside a flag value (`--include=*.py`), which under fish is
// a hard error rather than the literal passthrough bash gives you.
//
// It failed this crate's own admission test. A rule earns a guard when the
// failure it prevents is SILENT — `pipe-to-tail` qualifies because the pipeline
// reports success whatever the mutating command did, so no correcting loop can
// form. A zero-match glob under fish aborts the command loudly and names the
// glob, which is the best feedback a person or a model can get; the measured
// rate was falling on its own accordingly (12.9 per thousand in early July,
// 3.4 by mid-August).
//
// It was also the only rule that needed to know which shell was running, which
// meant either reading the environment inside a pure `examine` or coupling a
// tool published to crates.io, npm and Homebrew to one shell's semantics.
// Neither is worth a rule that should almost never fire.

/// What a rule is allowed to DO when it fires.
///
/// Three states, not two, and the middle one is the point. `Observe` and
/// `Advise` are not interchangeable ways of "not blocking yet": `Advise` puts
/// text into the model's context and therefore changes its behaviour, which
/// contaminates the very rate the observation exists to measure. A rule that
/// talks is intervening.
///
/// So: `Observe` is where every rule ships and where the baseline is measured.
/// `Advise` answers "does it correct itself when told?" — and if the answer is
/// yes, `Deny` is never needed.
// `Advise` and `Deny` are declared here and constructed by nothing yet: the
// build order deliberately ships the backtester and the rules BEFORE the hook
// that can act on them, so that no rule can block until its rate has been
// looked at. The ladder is the design; the rungs above `Observe` come with the
// hook path.
