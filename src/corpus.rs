//! Reviewed judgements, kept as a test.
//!
//! A rule's fire rate says how *often* it speaks. It says nothing about whether
//! it is right, and being right is the whole product: recall is recoverable —
//! a rule that misses something can be widened next week and the backtester
//! will price it — while one false positive refuses work the author knew was
//! correct, and the response to that is to delete the hook from
//! `settings.json`, which switches off every rule at once.
//!
//! So precision needs evidence, and evidence needs a human. The loop is:
//!
//! ```text
//! amont-agent explain <rule> --format cases >> tests/corpus/<rule>.cases
//! $EDITOR tests/corpus/<rule>.cases      # turn each `?` into match / nomatch
//! amont-agent corpus check               # and it is now a test
//! ```
//!
//! **The review output IS the corpus format.** There is no separate "mark as
//! reviewed" tool, because a review workflow with two file formats is one
//! nobody completes.
//!
//! ## Why a file and not a metric
//!
//! Tracking precision over time would chart the regression. A checked-in file
//! of labelled judgements *prevents* it: `corpus check` runs in the test suite,
//! so widening a rule in a way that breaks a judgement somebody already made is
//! a red build, not a number that drifts while nobody is looking.
//!
//! ## One line per case
//!
//! 35% of real commands span several lines, so newlines and tabs are escaped on
//! the way in and restored on the way out. The escaping is deliberately the
//! smallest thing that round-trips, because a corpus nobody can read by eye is
//! a corpus nobody will label.
