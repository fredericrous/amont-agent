//! The hook payload, as it arrives on stdin.
//!
//! Claude Code writes one JSON object to this process's stdin before it runs a
//! tool, and reads a decision back from stdout. The shape is defined by
//! somebody else and grows between releases, which decides how it is read here:
//! [`serde_json::Value`] and hand-written accessors, never a
//! `#[derive(Deserialize)]` struct.
//!
//! The difference matters at exactly one moment. A derived struct turns a
//! renamed or retyped field into a hard parse error, and the temptation is then
//! to treat that error as *something* — to block, or to warn. Reading field by
//! field turns the same event into an absent value, which this crate already
//! knows how to answer: no opinion. A guard that starts refusing commands
//! because a payload gained a field is worse than no guard.
//!
//! ## Everything unrecognised is silence
//!
//! Not our event, not our tool, no command, unparseable JSON, a `cwd` that no
//! longer exists — every one of those returns [`Event::NotOurs`], and the
//! caller exits 0 having written nothing.
