//! Where a rule's stance comes from.
//!
//! Compiled default, overridden by git config, with an environment kill switch
//! on top:
//!
//! ```text
//! rule.default_stance  <  amont.agent.stance  <  amont.agent.<id>.stance
//! ```
//!
//! then clamped to `Observe` if the guard is switched off.
//!
//! ## Why git config and not `amont.conf`
//!
//! `amont.conf` is committed. A rule that a committed file could promote to
//! `Deny` would mean cloning a repository hands it the power to refuse your
//! shell commands — the trust prompt helps, but it is a yes/no over a whole
//! file, which is the wrong granularity for "which of my commands may be
//! blocked". Promotion power stays on the machine, with the person.
//!
//! `amont.conf`'s parser also rejects any stage but `pre-commit`/`pre-push`,
//! and `policy::from_lines` validates targets against `registry::CHECKS`, which
//! will never contain these rules. Teaching it otherwise would be a change to
//! the dependency-free commit path in service of this crate — exactly the
//! coupling the separate crate exists to avoid.
//!
//! ## The kill switch is an environment variable on purpose
//!
//! Reading a git config key costs a process. `$AMONT_AGENT_OFF` costs nothing
//! and is checked first, before any rule has run. `amont.agent.enabled` exists
//! too, but it is consulted only once something has already fired — where its
//! effect is to clamp to silence anyway. That asymmetry looks like an
//! inconsistency and is a deliberate one.
